# This script demonstrates the implementation of a modular Python framework
# using Delta Lake and the Medallion Architecture to process data from bronze to silver layer

# Delta Lake enables ACID transactions, scalable metadata handling, and unifies streaming and batch data processing
# The Medallion Architecture organizes data into bronze (raw), silver (cleaned), and gold (aggregated) layers

# Read from bronze layer using Athena SQL
# Bronze layer typically contains raw, unprocessed data
# SQL query to read animal event data from the bronze layer goes here
# Example:
# SELECT * FROM bronze_layer.animal_events
# WHERE event_date >= DATE_SUB(CURRENT_DATE, 7)

# Advantages of Delta Lake and open format tables:
# 1. ACID Transactions: Ensures data consistency and integrity during concurrent operations
# 2. Time Travel: Allows querying and rolling back to previous versions of the data
# 3. Schema Evolution: Supports easy schema changes without breaking existing queries
# 4. Unified Batch and Streaming: Enables processing of both batch and streaming data in a single system
# 5. Open Format: Data is stored in Parquet format, allowing easy access from various tools and frameworks

# Write to silver layer
# Silver layer typically contains cleaned and transformed data

# Note: The Medallion Architecture allows for better data organization, easier debugging,
# and improved data quality as data moves through the layers (bronze -> silver -> gold)
